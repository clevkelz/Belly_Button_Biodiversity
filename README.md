## Dashboard and Supporting Charts

Volunteer belly button bacteria data compiled in a .JSON file (samples.JSON) was used to create dashboard. The ulimate purpose of this analysis is to determine whether there are sufficient bacteria in people's navels that could lead to the develpment of synthetic beef that could be harvested through this bacteria.

Information regarding the bacteria on individual volunteers is chosen through a drop-down menu.  After selecting the volunteer ID, several items appear.  The first is a summary of the volunteers demographic information:  identification number, ethnicity, gender, age, location, belly button type, and frequency of weekly belly button washing.  Clicking on a specific identification number also results in the generation of a bar chart listing top the top ten belly button IDs by volunteer along with a bubble chart illustrating the relative quantity of bacteria across the selected bacteria screen for the study.
